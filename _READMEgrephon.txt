docs/ cleanup in August 2025

I added all the changes NCC asked for a few more small tweaks to the working files (those that cross-ref etc.) and left them in docs/ See commit: 47c7fb5523eb55e36bc324bd185bbe1708ada1b0

Then I copied these over and made them ready for NCC formatting (god willing?).
I detail what changed between in _dothisGREPHON.txt (24 August 2025, look for: Here's what I changed from the files in docs/ (the useful files) and the ones in docs/grephonmsFINALncc/
