# Go through consistency of entries...

## CJC 4Aug: not sure if necessary but capitalize france for consistency
d$country <- ifelse(d$country=="france", "France", d$country)

# First is growth metric, we make a new column called growth
table(d$growth_metric)

## Check by CJC 4Aug:
sool <- d[(d$paper_id %in% c("soolananayakanahally2013", "soolananayakanahally2014")),]
table(sool$growth_metric, sool$paper_id)
## Updated by CJC 9Aug:
d$paper_id <- ifelse(d$paper_id == "soolananayakanahally2014", "soolananayakanahally2013", d$paper_id)
sort(unique(d$paper_id))
# Now at 37 papers! As expected.

## Deal with multiple growth metrics (questions: are we okay with number of rows?)
subset(d, growth_metric=="height,  root:shoot ratio") # Soolananayakanahally2013; this paper already seems broken out a lot so I think okay
## CJC 4Aug comment: Soolananayakanahally2013 has "height" and "height, root:shoot ratio", I think we can separate the two maybe?
## EMW replies to CJC: We planned on one row per response variable when they were similar like this, so leaving for now
