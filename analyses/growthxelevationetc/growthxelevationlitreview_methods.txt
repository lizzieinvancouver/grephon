Using Google Scholar and ISI Web of Science, we searched the literature for studies of tree growth, especially via diameter or ring width, by elevation or latitude. Of 18 papers we found for these relationships, six included clear raw tree data in either scatterplots or tables that we scraped. 

We could not scrape data from 13 papers for the following reasons: 
1) Absence of observational tree growth raw data: Some studies only presented the correlation or the data was modeled. 
2) Measures other variables: Some studies examined leaf area index and forest NPP. 
3) Standardization of tree growth with other variables: Papers did not present the raw data (e.g., papers presented the data calculated with other variables).
4) Presence of overlapping data points: Data points in the plots presented were not visually identifiable for accurate data scraping.
5) Line graphs: No discrete data points for image processing. 
6) Geographical scale: The locations of data collection spread across large longitudinal or latitudinal gradient. 

We scraped tree growth data from the selected studies using the Fiji image processing package with the Figure Calibration plugin. We calibrated x and y axis using the Figure Calibration plugin, followed by measuring growth values at different elevation using the measure function in Fiji. Of the six remaining papers, we show results for four, excluding huang2010 because it included only results for trends by latitude (and most other studies included only trends by elevation), and zhu2018 because the elevation co-varied with latitude. 

Data from Wang et al. was collected in Luyashan Mountains in the North China (38°40′ - 38°50′N, 111°50′ - 112°00′E) (2017). The tree cores were collected from 4 different sites across an elevation gradient: 1970m, 2240m, 2490m, and 2650m. The time span and DBH for tree sampled in each site is 1970-2007 (35±5 years) and 13.9±4.7 cm in site 1, 1917-2007 and 23.2±5 cm in site 2, 1897-2007 and 16±4.5 cm in site 3, and 1947-2007 and 17.5±4.9 cm in site 4. The average tree age in from site 1 to 4 are 35±5, 75±7, 74±10, and 52±6 years old. In each site, three 400 m^2 plots were surveyed to identify for the site.  In total, there were 147 tree cores collected from 73 trees. We presented the median of tree ring width values from the collected cores. 

Oleksyn et al. measured 54 populations of Picea abies along 8 altitudinal transect from 600m to 1500m  in Southern Poland (49°20'N - 50°18'N, 16°46'E - 20°06 E) in 1988 and 1989. The plots were 0.33 ha and every 5th tree was measured in each plot/population.We used DBH and height increment measurements from this study.

Tree ring width of Pinus yunnar from 6 altitudinal transects between 1600m to 2500m in Yunnan, China (26°31′50″ N, 100°24′51″ E) were collected in Zhou et al.'s study (2022). At least 20 trees were measured from each site, and we used tree ring width for our visualization.
