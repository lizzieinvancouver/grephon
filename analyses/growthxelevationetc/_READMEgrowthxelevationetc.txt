This folder includes TWO types of ways we tried to look at growth x elevation:
(1) Using a lit review, which Britany Wu help (see https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/24) 
(2) Using Mount Rainier data which Ailene did most of.


Quick overview of files:

growthxelevationlitreview_methods.txt -- methods for lit review 
mora_growthvelev.R -- plotting Mount Rainier data
plotgrowthbyelev.R -- plotting both types of data
plotgrowthbyelevlitreview.R -- plotting lit review data *Has current figure in main text*

Input/calvinjump_subsetTableS1.csv Lizzie extracted from the paper's XLSX supplement (Table S1).
