The Zohner paper is really relevant to understanding how climate influences the end of season (EOS), as defined by remote sensing data (greenness declines in northern forests), the timing of leaf abscission / senescence (from phenological observations), and the decline of chlorophyll content in leaves of beech. However, they don't directly explore temperature effects on growth responses, but instead explore the effects of photosynthesis / productivity pre and post solstic on EOS... Of course, satellite data and PEP data also don't include growth measurements, so that would have been tough (although maybe they could have done something clever with NDVI integrated under the curve, or with ITRDB data for the PEP analysis), but they coudl certainly have done a better job with their experiment.
