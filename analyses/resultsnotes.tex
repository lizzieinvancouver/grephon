\emph{Parking lot for results we may use:}


Most papers found evidence of positive relationship between growth and growing season length (21 papers, with the rest not testing for any relationship or not finding one). 10 papers found evidence for vegetative development related to growth. However, 13 papers did not find evidence of other growth x season length relationships they tested, and 7 tested for but did not find evidence of vegetative development related to growth---making the evidence for and against these relationships clearly split.

Out of 37 papers, 7 had data to test our definition, but did not.
