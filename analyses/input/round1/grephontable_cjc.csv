mckown2016,CJC,temperate forest,1,Populus trichocarpa,54 individuals from 16 genotypes with latitudinal gradient,greenhouse,across individuals,3-4,photosynthetic rate,plant vegetative phenology,leaf production,bud set,yes,yes,NA,fig 4,not sure,"doesn't give much information on start of season, just end of season",no,NA,NA,yes,no,NA,"no - it doesn't tell us the actual growing season length, more focuses on end of season. It only assesses one species and doesn't look at multiple years",more information on start of growth,they also assessed lammas growth which had the same results as the budset,not sure if I need to do each row twice to say lammas for end of season

desauvage2022,CJC,temperate forest,1,Quercus petraea,9 populations along an elevational gradient of 1500 m in the French,tree ring,across sites/populations across years within individuals,2-3 individuals for 5-6 years per population,annual core,plant vegetative phenology,leaf unfolding,leaf coloration,no,NA,yes,fig 4,no,there is no correlation between longer growing seasons and increased ring width,yes,yes,temperature,yes,yes,elevation,pretty close - it would be great if they had more species and across more locations,no,they found no relationship between phenology and radial growth,"but they found that higher temps at higher elevations lead to increased radial growth, whereas higher temps at lower elevations decreased growth, likely due to water availability"
