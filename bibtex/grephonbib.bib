   length, challenge the principle of uniformi-tarianism, i.e., that
   current relations are persistent over time, and complicates the
   uncritical inferences of past climate from tree-ring data. Here we
   conduct a comparison between tree-ring width chronologies of Pinus
   syl-vestris L. (Scots pine), Picea abies (L.) Karst. (Norway spruce) and
   Betula pubescens Ehrh. (Downy birch) and phenological observations
   (budburst and leaf senescence) of Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech),
   Quercus robur L. (European oak), Betula sp. (Birch), Norway spruce and
   Scots pine) in Sweden to assess to what extent the tree -ring
   width-temperature relationship and the timing of phenological phases are
   affected by increased tempera-ture. Daily meteorological observations
   confirm a prolongation of the thermal growing season, most consistently
   observed as an earlier onset of around 1-2 weeks since the beginning of
   the 20th century. Observations of budburst closely mimic this pattern,
   with budburst of the deciduous trees occurring 1-2.5 weeks earlier. In
   contrast to the changes seen in phenology and observational temperature
   data, the tree-ring width-temperature relationships remain surprisingly
   stable throughout the 20th century. Norway spruce, Scots pine and Downy
   birch all show consistently significant correlations with at least one
   30 day-long window of temperature starting in late June-early July
   season. Norway spruce displays the largest degree of stability, with a
   consistent 60 day-long temperature window with significant correlation
   starting around Julian calendar day 150. Thus, our results suggest that
   the principle of uniformitarianism is not violated during the period
   covered by modern meteoro-logical observations. Further research is
   needed to determine at what thresholds the temperature sensitivity of
   these species may alter or deteriorate as a consequence of the ongoing

	abstract = {The high sensitivity of Nothofagus pumilio growth to climate variations
   at upper treelines provides a unique opportunity to document changes in
   tree responses to a warmer climate in the Patagonian Andes. In the
   context of significant recent temperature and precipitation changes
   across Patagonia, we conducted a study along the precipitation gradient
   in the Rio de las Vueltas basin, southern Patagonian Andes, to: (1)
   document differences in N. pumilio growth trends at upper treelines, (2)
   determine changes in climate-growth relationships along the
   precipitation gradient, and (3) estimate future growth responses to
   simulated 21st century warming. For the past 100 years, mean tree-ring
   width increases progressively from wet to dry treelines in response to
   less abundant precipitation and less persistent snow cover into the
   growing season. Mountain aspect regulates snow cover duration and hence
   growing season length, thereby also influencing tree-ring width. On
   interannual scale, temperature directly modulates tree-growth variations
   in wet and mesic treelines, but is inversely related to growth in dry
   sites. Growth trends show that the approximate 0.56C temperature
   increment since the mid -1970's in the Patagonian Andes dramatically
   enhanced the recorded long-term increasing growth rates at mesic, but to
   a lesser extent at humid treelines, suggesting nonlinear interactions
   between temperature and snow persistence on tree growth. Contrarily,
   growth rates at dry treelines decreased over the past 100 years. Our
   predictive statistical models indicate sustained decadal increases in
   current radial growth rates at wet and mesic sites and decreases at dry
   treelines towards the end of the 21st century under the simulated future
   warming scenarios for the southern Andes. However, the nonlinear
   relationships between warming, snow cover and tree growth, combined with
   unreliable estimates of precipitation for the region during the 21st
   century, suggest that these simulated changes in tree growth should be
   viewed with caution.},

   environmental conditions, and are directly related to the key functions
   and physiological processes of trees. However, little is known about the
   responses of xylem to recent rapid warming in many areas. Based on the
   anatomical features of the xylem of Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr. from 14
   sites in two contrasting areas (warm-dry and cold-wet) of northeast
   China, the plasticity response and adaptation strategies of radial
   growth, earlywood vessels (EWV), and hydraulic features of F.
   mandshurica to climate change were studied. Results showed that,
   compared with the cold-wet area, F. mandshurica in warm-dry area had
   wider rings, larger vessel area, higher number of vessels (VN), larger
   hydraulic diameters (Dh) and higher theoretical tree-ring hydraulic
   conductivity (Kh). On the contrary, the vessel density (VD), percentage
   of EWV (PC) and xylem-specific theoretical hydraulic conductivity (Ks)
   in warm-dry area was lower than those in cold-wet area. In these two
   areas, the RW, mean vessel area (MVA), total vessel area (TVA), VN, Dh,
   and Kh were significantly positively correlated with temperature, and
   negatively correlated with winter moisture. However, the PC, VD, and Ks
   were inversely related to climate factors in the two areas. F.
   mandshurica can adjust the density and proportion of EWV by changing the
   configuration of earlywood and latewood to cope with the interannual
   climate change and balance the hydraulic efficiency and safety. Rapid
   warming significantly increased the growing season length and hydraulic
   efficiency of F. mandshurica in warm-dry and cold-wet areas, thus
   maximizing carbon fixation. This provides a potential physiological
   explanation for the growth increase and range expansion of the main
   broadleaf tree species in temperate zone of northeast China in recent
   years. F. mandshurica in warm-dry areas benefits greatly from continuous
   climate warming, but the risk of hydraulic failure may increase.},

	abstract = {Wood growth constitutes the main process for long-term atmospheric
   carbon sequestration in vegetation. However, our understanding of the
   process of wood growth and its response to environmental drivers is
   limited. Current dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are mainly
   photosynthesis-driven and thus do not explicitly include a direct
   environmental effect on tree growth. However, physiological evidence
   suggests that, to realistically model vegetation carbon allocation under
   increased climatic stressors, it is crucial to treat growth responses
   independently from photosynthesis. A plausible growth response function
   suitable for global simulations in DGVMs has been lacking. Here, we
   present the first soil water-growth response function and parameter
   range for deciduous and evergreen conifers. The response curve was
   calibrated against European larch and Norway spruce in a dry temperate
   forest in the Swiss Alps. We present a new data-driven approach based on
   a combination of tree ring width (TRW) records, growing season length
   and simulated subdaily soil hydrology to parameterize ring width
   increment simulations. We found that a simple linear response function,
   with an intercept at zero moisture stress, used in growth simulations
   reproduced 62.3\% and 59.4\% of observed TRW variability for larch and
   spruce respectively and, importantly, the response function slope was
   much steeper than literature values for soil moisture effects on
   photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. Specifically, we found stem
   growth stops at soil moisture potentials of -0.47 MPa for larch and
   -0.66 MPa for spruce, whereas photosynthesis in trees continues down to
   -1.2 MPa or lower, depending on species and measurement method. These
   results are strong evidence that the response functions of source and
   sink processes are indeed very different in trees, and need to be
   considered separately to correctly assess vegetation responses to
   environmental change. The results provide a parameterization for the
   explicit representation of growth responses to soil water in vegetation
   models.},

	abstract = {How, where, and why carbon (C) moves into and out of an ecosystem
   through time are long-standing questions in biogeochemistry. Here, we
   bring together hundreds of thousands of C-cycle observations at the
   Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA, a mid-latitude landscape
   dominated by 80-120-yr-old closed-canopy forests. These data answered
   four questions: (1) where and how much C is presently stored in dominant
   forest types; (2) what are current rates of C accrual and loss; (3) what
   biotic and abiotic factors contribute to variability in these rates; and
   (4) how has climate change affected the forest's C cycle? Harvard Forest
   is an active C sink resulting from forest regrowth following land
   abandonment. Soil and tree biomass comprise nearly equal portions of
   existing C stocks. Net primary production (NPP) averaged 680-750 g
   C.m(-2).yr(-1); belowground NPP contributed 38-47\% of the total, but
   with large uncertainty. Mineral soil C measured in the same inventory
   plots in 1992 and 2013 was too heterogeneous to detect change in soil-C
   pools; however, radiocarbon data suggest a small but persistent sink of
   10-30 g C.m(-2).yr(-1). Net ecosystem production (NEP) in hardwood
   stands averaged similar to 300 g C.m(-2).yr(-1). NEP in
   hemlock-dominated forests averaged similar to 450 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) until
   infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid turned these stands into a net

   1992-2015, NEP increased 93\%. The increase in mean annual temperature
   and growing season length alone accounted for similar to 30\% of the
   increase in productivity. Interannual variations in GPP and NEP were
   also correlated with increases in red oak biomass, forest leaf area, and
   canopy-scale light-use efficiency. Compared to long-term global change
   experiments at the Harvard Forest, the C sink in regrowing biomass
   equaled or exceeded C cycle modifications imposed by soil warming, N
   saturation, and hemlock removal. Results of this synthesis and

@article{francon2020,
	abstract = {Enhanced shrub growth in a warming alpine climate has potential
   far-reaching implications, including soil nutrient cycling, carbon
   storage, or water and surface energy exchanges. Growth ring analysis can
   yield mid- to long-term, annually resolved records of shrub growth, and
   thereby offer valuable insights into how growth is driven by interannual
   climate variability. In the European Alps, dendroecological approaches
   have shown that dwarf shrub productivity is influenced by interannual
   variations of growing season temperature but results also point to a
   negative effect of winter precipitation on radial growth. However, as
   past work lacked snow cover data, links between snow cover duration,
   growing season length, energy availability and inter-annual shrub growth
   remain poorly understood.
   In this paper, we combined multi-decadal shrub-ring series from 49
   individuals sampled at three sites along a 600-m elevational gradient in
   the Taillefer massif, located in the French Alps to assess growth
   sensitivity of long-lived and widespread Rhododendron ferrugineum shrubs
   to both snow cover dynamics and temperature changes. To this end, we
   computed structural equation models to track the response of shrub
   radial growth to extending growing season at 1800, 2000 and 2400 m above
   sea level and for two time periods (i.e. 1959-1988 and 1989-2016). The
   second period is marked by a significant advance in snow melt-out
   resulting in a regime shift highlighted at the end of the 1980s by a
   breakpoint analysis.
   At the high-elevation site, our results demonstrate a positive effect of
   increasing growing season length on shrub growth, which is strongly
   dependent on snowpack depth and snow cover duration. Conversely, at
   lower elevations, earlier melt-out dates and associated late frost
   exposure are shown to lead to radial growth reduction. Moreover, the
   climate signal in ring-width chronologies of R. ferrugineum portrays a
   weakening since 1988 - similar to a phenomenon observed in series from
   circumpolar and alpine tree-ring sites and referred to as
   ``divergence{''}.
   By analyzing long-term records of radial growth along an elevation
   gradient, our work provides novel insights into the complex responses of
   shrub growth to climate change in alpine environments. This paper
   demonstrates that R. ferrugineum, as a dominant alpine shrub species,
   behave as an ecological indicator of the response of alpine ecosystem to
   global warming.},

	abstract = {Xylem anomalies that are caused by unusual climate events have long been
   used to aid cross-dating in tree ring research. Here, we analyzed a
   range of xylem anomalies in a 39-year-old common garden experiment of
   white spruce (Picea glauca {[}Moench] Voss) in central Alberta, Canada,
   designed to investigate local adaptation. We extracted wood cores from
   trees representing 24 provenances covering much of the species range
   across the Canadian boreal forest. Using a double stain and light
   microscopy analysis, four xylem anomalies and their causes could be
   distinguished: (1) frost rings indicate issues with synchronizing the
   onset of growth with the start of the growing season, and were prevalent
   in young trees; (2) light rings represent thin cell walls caused by an
   insufficient growing season length, most prevalent in southern sources;
   (3) blue rings were caused by a failure to complete lignification of new
   wood due to an early end of the growing season; and (4) double rings
   represent density fluctuations due to drier than normal summers. Local
   provenances showed the least amount of xylem anomalies, indicating that
   they are correctly adapted to the environment in which they occur. In
   contrast, trees moved to the test site from other climate regions showed
   various types of xylem anomalies depending on their origin. In
   particular, populations originating from warmer regions showed an
   increased presence of latewood anomalies, consistent with a more
   extensive use of the growing season in the fall. We conclude that xylem
   anomalies may serve as a sensitive early indicator of maladaptation to
   climate before populations experience tree dieback or mortality. They
   may therefore be useful to monitor the health of natural populations, or
   to evaluate the success of assisted migration in reforestation to
   address climate change.},

	abstract = {A number of studies have suggested that growing season length determines
   carbon sequestration of forest ecosystems. Given the possibility that
   drought-induced growth decline will be caused by a prolonged growing
   season under a warming climate, we investigated the effect of growth
   rate and duration of xylem production on annual wood biomass in
   drought-prone environments. We analyzed the intra-annual dynamics of
   wood formation in Qilian junipers (Juniperus przewalskii) from the
   semi-arid north-eastern Tibetan Plateau, China (2009-2014) and in
   ponderosa pine (Pines ponderosa) from the hyperacid Mojave Desert in
   Nevada, USA (2015-2016). Most variability in the number of xylem cells
   (N-cell) was related to growth rate (r(m)) rather than duration of cell
   production (D-cell). At the Tibetan sites, 69.9\% and 54.7\% of
   variability in N-cell was attributable to r(m) for the lower and upper
   treeline, respectively. Within the Mojave Desert site, 53.9\% of the
   variability in N-cell was related to r(m). The growth rate in the
   Tibetan Plateau forest is affected by minimum temperature and
   precipitation. Thus, r(m) is a primary control on wood biomass in
   conifer species of semi-arid forests. Under warmer and drier conditions,
   a longer growing season will not benefit xylem formation of conifers,
   and in turn warming-induced drought could limit carbon sequestration by
   reducing the rate of cell production.},

	abstract = {Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) and foxtail pine (Pinus
   balfouriana) are valuable paleoclimate resources due to their longevity
   and climatic sensitivity of their annually-resolved rings. Treeline
   research has shown that growing season temperatures limit tree growth at
   and just below the upper treeline. In the Great Basin, the presence of
   precisely dated remnant wood above modern treeline shows that the
   treeline ecotone shifts at centennial timescales tracking long-term
   changes in climate; in some areas during the Holocene climatic optimum
   treeline was 100 meters higher than at present. Regional treeline
   position models built exclusively from climate data may identify
   characteristics specific to Great Basin treelines and inform future
   physiological studies, providing a measure of climate sensitivity
   specific to bristlecone and foxtail pine treelines. This study
   implements a topoclimatic analysis-using topographic variables to
   explain patterns in surface temperatures across diverse mountainous
   terrain-to model the treeline position of three semi-arid bristlecone
   and/or foxtail pine treelines in the Great Basin as a function of
   growing season length and mean temperature calculated from in situ
   measurements. Results indicate: (1) the treeline sites used in this
   study are similar to other treelines globally, and require a growing
   season length of between 147-153 days and average temperature ranging
   from 5.5 degrees C-7.2 degrees C, (2) site-specific treeline position
   models may be improved through topoclimatic analysis and (3) treeline
   position in the Great Basin is likely out of equilibrium with the
   current climate, indicating a possible future upslope shift in treeline

	abstract = {The impact of 2 X CO2 driven climate change on radial growth of boreal
   tree species Pinus banksiana Lamb., Populus tremuloides Michx. and Picea
   mariana (Mill.) BSP growing in the Duck Mountain Provincial Forest of
   Manitoba (DMPF), Canada, is simulated using empirical and process-based
   model approaches. First, empirical relationships between growth and
   climate are developed. Stepwise multiple-regression models are conducted
   between tree-ring growth increments (TRGI) and monthly drought,
   precipitation and temperature series. Predictive skills are tested using
   a calibration-verification scheme. The established relationships are
   then transferred to climates driven by 1x and 2 x CO2 scenarios using
   outputs from the Canadian second-generation coupled global climate
   model. Second, empirical results are contrasted with process-based
   projections of net primary productivity allocated to stem development
   (NPPs). At the finest scale, a leaf-level model of photosynthesis is
   used to simulate canopy properties per species and their interaction
   with the variability in radiation, temperature and vapour pressure
   deficit. Then, a top-down plot-level model of forest productivity is
   used to simulate landscape-level productivity by capturing the
   between-stand variability in forest cover. Results show that the
   predicted TRGI from the empirical models account for up to 56.3\% of the
   variance in the observed TRGI over the period 1912-1999. Under a 2 x CO2
   scenario, the predicted impact of climate change is a radial growth
   decline for all three species under study. However, projections obtained
   from the process-based model suggest that an increasing growing season
   length in a changing climate could counteract and potentially overwhelm
   the negative influence of increased drought stress. The divergence
   between TRGI and NPPs simulations likely resulted, among others, from
   assumptions about soil water holding capacity and from calibration of
   variables affecting gross primary productivity. An attempt was therefore
   made to bridge the gap between the two modelling approaches by using
   physiological variables as TRGI predictors. Results obtained in this
   manner are similar to those obtained using climate variables, and
   suggest that the positive effect of increasing growing season length
   would be counteracted by increasing summer temperatures. Notwithstanding
   uncertainties in these simulations (CO2 fertilization effect, feedback
   from disturbance regimes, phenology of species, and uncertainties in
   future CO2 emissions), a decrease in forest productivity with climate
   change should be considered as a plausible scenario in sustainable
   forest management planning of the DMPF. Crown Copyright (C) 2007

	abstract = {This paper reports annual carbon (C) balance of Canada's forests during
   1895-1996 estimated using the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem C-budget
   model (InTEC) {[}Chen et al., this issue]. During 1895-1910, Canada's
   forests were small sources of 30+/-15 Tg C yi due to large disturbances
   (forest fire, insect-induced mortality, and harvest) in late nineteenth
   century. The forests became large sinks of 17+/-85 Tg C yr(-1) during
   1930-1970, owing to forest regrowth in previously disturbed areas and
   growth stimulation by nondisturbance factors such as climate,
   atmospheric CO2 concentration, and N deposition. In recent decades
   (1980-1996), Canada's forests have been moderate sinks of 50+/-25 Tg C
   yr(-1), as a result: of a tradeoff between the negative effects of
   increased disturbances and positive effects of nondisturbance factors.
   The nondisturbance factors, in order of importance, are (1) atmospheric
   N deposition (measured by a national monitoring network), (2) net N
   mineralization and fixation (estimated from temperature and
   precipitation records), (3) growing season length increase (estimated
   from spring air temperature records), and (4) CO2 fertilization
   (estimated from CO2 records using a leaf-level photosynthesis model).
   The magnitudes of modeled nondisturbance effects are consistent with
   simulation results by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) and are
   also in broad agreement with flux measurements above mature forest
   stands at several locations in Canada. Results for the disturbance
   effects agree with a previous study {[}Kurz and Apps, 1996]. The overall
   C balance from InTEC generally agrees with that derived from tree ring
   data {[}Auclair and Bedford, 1997] and from forest inventories. The
   combination of our result and that of Houghton et al. {[}1999] for the
   United States suggests that North America (> 15 degrees N) was probably
   a C sink of 0.2-0.5 Pg C yr(-1) during 1980s, much less than that of 1.7
   Pg C yr(-1) estimated by Fan et al. {[}1998] using an atmospheric
   inversion method.},
