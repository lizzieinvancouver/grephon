May 2024 notes

Mid-May! I am a year older and in Zurich again, time to get this puppy done!
Planning to submit as Perspective to NCC (no presubmission needed) 

Waiting on:
	- Replies to issue #29 from Ailene
	- Updated methods etc on elevation from Britany

Need to do myself:
	- Finalize elevation methods -- and ADD cite to Oskelyn in fig capture. 
	- Decide if we want MORA elevation x growth in supp
	- Do something with new refs in this folder! And with docs/refsADD/
	- Get names and affiliations (do names by first letter of first name? Me, Ailene, Alana, Cat, Fredi, Kavya, Janneke, Ruben)


Submission:
https://www.nature.com/nclimate/content (no mention of abstract length)
https://www.nature.com/nclimate/submission-guidelines/initial-formatting
"Your initial submission does not need to be specially formatted, as long as the study is described in a way that is suitable for editorial assessment and peer review. "

January 2024 notes
Ohgod, it's January somehow.
And then it was March. 

- 9 March 2024: Listed a bunch of tasks that I eventually did!

- Since last meeting (mid-November) I have gotten feedback and help from:
	- Ailene
	- Cat (but comments in text remain, we are meeting this week)
	- Janneke (but has not done refs, and we're meeting this week)

- Basically I need to:
	- Figure out where the hypotheses numbers are ... and finalize that figure
	- Get more #s from lit review in paper
	- Feel good about closing out second round draft feedback: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/36
	- Get the figures finalized (see git issues and notes below)
	- Get people to help me with refs (I feel like a git issue with check boxes .. though annoying could be easiest at this point? Or just update \addcites to have specific names (\addcitesAlana etc.)

October 2023 notes
Lizzie worked on on a NEW draft

- List of things I need help with for the call
	- Alana's figure, incl. what is source/sink (https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/1)
	- Finalizing and integrating the hypothesis figure (https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/29)
	- Deciding on and writing the standardized methods section of supp	
	- Better heat maps for supp (https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/28) 
	- Methods vs. disciplines is sort of messy
	- Our methods for finding studies is not great (heads-up only)
	- If time allows:
		- Where to put CO2 fert: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/33

Note to self: If we use the growth x elevation figure, we should work on a table to organize these refs -- maybe a list of all we checked (see what Britany did; incl. Neil's emails)


<><><><><><><><><><><><>
On 25 September 2023 call:

Issues 26-30 and issue 23 (trends with elevation). Also, Janneke was going to fix bat mobile section.

From the 9 September 2023 email:

Figures:
- Ruben on PEP/ITRB with Cat's and my help
- Subfields relating -- Kavya
- GREPHON table stuff, including heat map -- Cat and Lizzie
- New version of growth x elevation -- Ailene

Other
- Measurement box -- Ailene
- Fix the bat mobile section -- Janneke
- List of all hypotheses and glossary: Frederik, Ailene, Kavya with Frederik in charge of scheduling/organizing this team



<><><><><><><><><><><><>
On 21 August (updated 23 September 2023 ... first day of fall, and 1 October 2023):

Below are DONE: 
(1) Add to manuscript: WHEN we should see the connection (currently in text without a home)
(2) Deal with issue #25 (feedback on draft)
(3) Deal with Rubén's comments in the PDF (docs/comments)
(4) Re-do the bat mobile section (in docs/comments)

<><><><><><><><><><><><>
From July 2023, I think: 

Send out a list of tasks:

EVERYONE: Send statements/snippets you think we need to include in paper. 

1. (Unlimited people) Fundamental lit on elevational gradients and tree rings -- what evidence is there for GSL to growth (two people, one of whom I think should be Janneke or Ailene) -- see issue #18

2. Someone to check my work on how I relabeled the growth metrics (issue # 15 and check BOTH the output and my code)

4. Someone to add to the code a sapling/adult column, including getting the info out of papers or people who are in charge of the papers. (Issue #17)

3. Someone to take over external and endogenous factors affected growth or gsl issue (#11) including getting everyone to send me data, and ideally writing some code to summarize it. 

5. Figure out summary for method (Alana?) 

6. Start working on Rubén's suggested idea of simplifying exogenous factors (in issue 10 now, could be new issue; work with Alana who started on this).

7. Simplify endogenous factors (please start an issue # ; work with Alana who started on this).


7 people:
Alana
Ruben
Kavya
Cat
Ailene
Janneke
Fredi

Do later: 
Refs and info on upper and temperature lower limits to tree growth and development.
Work on figures summarizing table results
Measurement diffs of growth -- in a box.
	Measurement -- see box/figure  (include measurement only here or briefly so we move through it fast; Table results: What metrics of growth? could fit here)
