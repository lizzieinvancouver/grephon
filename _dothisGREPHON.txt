23 May 2025 (edits due to 29 May)

STILL to do... 
- Add more citations to last sentence of box? 
- Check citation formatting -- fix it! It's all BOLD now.
- Note the DIFF file in cover letter?
- Update the diff (and bibtex it and cross-ref it)

23 May 2025 email

Your edits requested by *next Thursday* 

Hi all,

Thank you *all* for your help on edits to this ms! I much appreciated everyone's help and getting back to me on such a tight schedule -- I feel lucky for this team. I am thus turning this around on our tight-schedule. 

Attached please find the updated Grephon ms with:
- Main text* -- if you prefer to look at a diff version (but without the citations working), you can find it here: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/blob/main/docs/grephondiff.pdf
- Part 1 of the cover letter, which includes a point by point response to Tegan's comments (as requested it is in this part of the cover letter)
- Part 2 of the letter, which includes a point by point response to R2
- I have not changed the supp much but you can find it here: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/blob/main/docs/grephonsupp.pdf
* I will fix the references (somehow being bolded at 44) later. 

What's changed?
- I tried to cut down the section on phylo-traits framework and moved around some sections in the final part (I cut the conclusions)
- Made abstract (120 words) subheaders shorter (60 char) per NCC requirements
- Tried to add verbiage Tegan wanted throughout (let me know if now something sounds stupid or repetitive)
- Lots of edits to figure in box and box (for R2)

What I could use from you by **29 May (next Thursday)**
* Please make sure I got in your major edits correctly. 
* Please make edits in the tex of PDF files for problems you see. 
* Edits for typos or to make things tighter (i.e., shorter!) are especially appreciated. (Stylistic edits or edits that clarify by adding words are harder for me to deal with, and I reserve the right to ignore them.)

If I do not hear from you by the 29th I assume you are okay with the revisions.

I will aim to get all revisions from you in starting 30 May and then I resubmit the next week (week of 2 June). *If you want to see the submitted version after your edits are in, please tell me by 29 May.* Otherwise, I will assume you're okay not seeing the absolute last draft (if major edits are being made, I will tell everyone).  

Thank you again for all your help and if you have any questions or concerns, let me know.

All the best,
Lizzie

Grephon update: Your help needed by MONDAY, 19 May

Dear co-authors,

Thanks for your patience while I tracked down Tegan for some additional feedback. I met with her last week and the basic feedback was (in short):
(a) They seem interested in publishing it but we need to make it sound more like a progress article, and tighten it up in some specific ways and ... 
(b) They need another reviewer to sign on so we need to try to make R2 happy (any they will try R3 again and if all that fails we get a new reviewer -- ugh), but they recognize we cannot list all mechanisms or give a comprehensive mechanistic framework, but we need to add some citations about this and nod to it more (somehow). 

To address all this, I have started working on edits and am now looking for help from you. I have given most people a task that I hope you can work on to complete by end of *next Monday (19 May)*? I know that is short but I have frittered away some time tracking down Tegan (and I have a busy summer so it's either get it in by first week or June, or it will be mid-July and I don't think NCC sounded good on that). 

My proposed timeline is thus:
19 May (Monday) -- you all email me back 
23 May -- I send you a new draft with letter
29 May -- You send any edits back to me. 
I submit first week of June.

Also, I have tried to assign tasks that I hope will take maybe an hour (though I realize that depends on your style and some may take longer). 

Here's what I need help on (in general we need to keep the text short, so if I ask you to add, add the MINIMAL and suggest cuts if you see them):

* Cat: I have tried to add something about extreme events and/or interactions of climatic factors to the last paragraph of the external drivers section per a request of Tegan, can you see what you think and add any citations or more important points (look for 'Cat, can you help here?' in the tex file)? 
* Alana: Can you work on my new text for the box, especially the last paragraph and add any citations that you think are critical to have there? (And maybe I will cut the new first paragraph I added, see if you have any thoughts). 
* Kavya (and anyone who has ideas here): Can you find 2-4 good citations for the last sentence of the box: "but a full framework would benefit from an improved understanding of how stress operates at the cellular and molecular levels NEEDCITES."
* Rubén: Can you try to add some larger text or symbols or such I can reference to the figure in the box including something like:
	- Drought inhibits cell growth and tissue formation
	- Low temperature stops cell growth in meristems
* Ailene: I was asked to make sure each question section in 'Building a new framework for growth $\times$ season length' section (each subheader basically) follows: problem then solution. Some sections are better than others and I'd also love your help to CUT down the 'What is the pattern of responses across species?' sub-section (and see if you have any ideas of a better subheader).
* Fredi: Can you make citation suggestions for how there are now debates on source vs. sink control (currently first paragraph of box)?  
* Janneke (and anyone who has ideas here!): in the 'How prevalent are constraints across species and populations?' Tegan said we need 'more detail on what sort of internal constraints experiments we need (and why focusing on those is really easy). Could you add a sentence or two to that section that does this? 

Can you please let me know if you have any conflicts with the timeline (and suggestions for how to work around them, such as I work on your task and go ahead without you, or you just need an extra day or such)? Also, do you have funding to report? I will try to add it this round (but they may refuse as I have found journals have gotten pickier on adding this later than the initial submission). 

Attached is the current ms in tex, PDF and Word. Edits on the tex file are appreciated, but I will make it work however so do what works for you. Feel free to push edits on the repo. 

A short list of changes I have already made is below. Please let me know if you need anything else and otherwise, I hope to hear from you by *end of Monday, 19 May.*

And, happy first day of Eurovision (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK3HOMhAeQY ... if you enjoy this, find the acoustic version)!

All the best,

December 2024 & 
January 2025 notes

To do items (27 December 2024):
(0) Save current version of ms so can do track changes if requested (DONE)
(1) Draft figures and get feedback (done for now)
(2) Overhaul ms and work on response letter (same time) -- first pass DONE
(3) Comments from co-authors integrated (pretty close to done)
(4) Ask everyone about funding they want mentioned; done -- no one replied so need to ADD mine and RUBEN's on next draft

Consider:
- Delete 'expanding disciplinary focus' in supp
- Sneak masting into elevation section?

PLAN for figures and overhaul of section 3
Email to co-authors (late December 2024):
<><><><><>

Hi all,

Apologies to be emailing about work during the holiday break. No worries if you cannot respond to this email as I will email again once break is over, but given my schedule in January (and February), I need to make some progress on our Grephon paper now and wanted to solicit feedback for those who have time now. 

I chatted with Tegan in mid-December and my take-aways were that we do not have to remove the meta-analysis, they are interested, but need something new from our framework and they want something more opinionated with clearer steps forward (thus, the meta-analysis is less important because our new framework is more important and exciting). This need for more from our framework basically jives with the reviews and the conversation made me think we should resubmit. *We need to do it soon though -- so I am aiming to resubmit by end of January.* 

To that end, I am going to dive in on edits starting around New Year's Eve so any thoughts on my plan below by *end of Monday, 30 December* would be appreciated. 

How can you help now (*if you have time and want to, I assume most of you are offline and I support that*)? Share thoughts on my proposed overhaul of section 3, new figure ideas, and any ideas on what R2 wants. I have included these as separate sections below. Also, just any ideas on how to address the concerns of the reviewers are welcome! 

I'll sign off here and if you have time, continue reading below.

Happy holidays!

<><><><><>
A) My proposal is to overhaul sections 2 a little and and especially section 3 (`Building a new framework for growth × season length relationships') to be a list of the most important things to answer and to say HOW to do it, which would be:

i) What is the scale of variation in GSL x growth relationships across space (and time; or how does time compare). We don't know this and we need to. 

To answer this: go out and observationally measure the same species across latitude or elevation and aim to measure the RATE and TIMING of primary and secondary growth (getting at total SUM across season). 

ADDED (after email): Start with tree rings for this and then break it down by types of growth, GSL metrics etc. (Nail this pattern across space and species; and then fit in what we see/expect over time). 

ii) How prevalent are internal constraints across species and populations? New evidence suggests plants do not fully use longer seasons. If true, this would be critical to predicting future stuff, but it needs a lot more work to understand if (a) it is common across species, and populations (partition variance) and (b) holds up under different definitions of GSL (c) is backed up experimentally (Figure showing what we expect from experiments maybe?).

ADDED (after email): if you do different species in different places you're just learning about changes in species composition across space (and population dynamics), which might give you something but won't give you mechanism -- need models like Nacho's and Freckleton's

To answer this: Use some of what is used for (i) and add experiments (I guess?). 

iii) How do external drivers and internal constraints act together (or: how do they compare?)? 

To answer this: I was just going to hammer that we can build on data from (i) with better models, but we will have to have experiments here and then talk about some with juvenile plants and large-scale (we have some of this text). 

<><><><><>
B) NEW FIGURE ideas: 
(1) Figure to show variation in definitions of GSL while also touching on primary versus secondary growth: this could show some temperature data from Feb to October with phenological events and meteorological events layered on, then a panel showing primary and secondary growth accumulation under it, and then a panel under that showing the length of different GSL based on: phenological, meteorological and growth. 
(2) Figure showing primary versus secondary growth over a couple seasons that emphasizes legacy effects (not sure how this should look)
(3) Figure showing different species growing at different rates across seasons: could  show some temperature data from Feb to October with phenological events (different for each species) and then another panel showing rates and sums of growth over season for each one ... this is sort of similar to Fig 1, but different emphasis (and no GSL). It could also show legacy effects ... 
(4) Figure emphasizing what to do next ... could be showing experiments that alter length and temperature of season and try to tease out rates versus length -- showing what we would find for internal constraints versus external constraints (this could combine with idea (3) above). 
(5) Somehow combine current Fig 2 and 4 to emphasize complexity of season length and rates -- e.g., higher elevations have shorter season but also never get as warm....

<><><><><>
C) 
I could use help interpreting Reviewer #2 (and just generally how to make them happy). This includes ideas beyond those proposed to address their concerns and I specifically am confused about what is meant:

"For example, we don’t know how/whether climatic factors directly or indirectly alter growth seasons via internal constraints, and then affect growth." 

"3. As shown in Fig. 1g in the manuscript, this hypothesis indicates that the growing season length and growth are unchanged due to internal constraints. However, this hypothesis may be wrong and is not supported by the listed References, (e.g., Zohner et al., 2023 SCIENCE). 1) the growth onset is not unchanged, and should be advanced under global warming. For example, recent research has suggested that warming-induced earlier spring phenology is driven by increased photosynthetic carbon assimilation in the previous growing season (see Gu et al., 2022 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS). 2) The peak growth and their timing should be increased and advanced due to source-sink balances/limitations under global change (see Korner et al., 2015; Green et al., 2022 SCIENCE). 3) the growth end timing is also changed and is jointly controlled by climatic factors and internal constraints (see Zohner et al., 2023 SCIENCE)."

If anyone sees through this and can explain over email or has time for a call with me, please let me know.

January 2024 notes
Ohgod, it's January somehow.
And then it was March. 

- 9 March 2024: Listed a bunch of tasks that I eventually did!

- Since last meeting (mid-November) I have gotten feedback and help from:
	- Ailene
	- Cat (but comments in text remain, we are meeting this week)
	- Janneke (but has not done refs, and we're meeting this week)

- Basically I need to:
	- Figure out where the hypotheses numbers are ... and finalize that figure
	- Get more #s from lit review in paper
	- Feel good about closing out second round draft feedback: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/36
	- Get the figures finalized (see git issues and notes below)
	- Get people to help me with refs (I feel like a git issue with check boxes .. though annoying could be easiest at this point? Or just update \addcites to have specific names (\addcitesAlana etc.)


<><><><><><><><><><><><>
October 2023 notes
Lizzie worked on on a NEW draft

- List of things I need help with for the call
	- Alana's figure, incl. what is source/sink (https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/1)
	- Finalizing and integrating the hypothesis figure (https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/29)
	- Deciding on and writing the standardized methods section of supp	
	- Better heat maps for supp (https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/28) 
	- Methods vs. disciplines is sort of messy
	- Our methods for finding studies is not great (heads-up only)
	- If time allows:
		- Where to put CO2 fert: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/issues/33

Note to self: If we use the growth x elevation figure, we should work on a table to organize these refs -- maybe a list of all we checked (see what Britany did; incl. Neil's emails)


<><><><><><><><><><><><>
On 25 September 2023 call:

Issues 26-30 and issue 23 (trends with elevation). Also, Janneke was going to fix bat mobile section.

From the 9 September 2023 email:

Figures:
- Ruben on PEP/ITRB with Cat's and my help
- Subfields relating -- Kavya
- GREPHON table stuff, including heat map -- Cat and Lizzie
- New version of growth x elevation -- Ailene

Other
- Measurement box -- Ailene
- Fix the bat mobile section -- Janneke
- List of all hypotheses and glossary: Frederik, Ailene, Kavya with Frederik in charge of scheduling/organizing this team



<><><><><><><><><><><><>
On 21 August (updated 23 September 2023 ... first day of fall, and 1 October 2023):

Below are DONE: 
(1) Add to manuscript: WHEN we should see the connection (currently in text without a home)
(2) Deal with issue #25 (feedback on draft)
(3) Deal with Rubén's comments in the PDF (docs/comments)
(4) Re-do the bat mobile section (in docs/comments)

<><><><><><><><><><><><>
From July 2023, I think: 

Send out a list of tasks:

EVERYONE: Send statements/snippets you think we need to include in paper. 

1. (Unlimited people) Fundamental lit on elevational gradients and tree rings -- what evidence is there for GSL to growth (two people, one of whom I think should be Janneke or Ailene) -- see issue #18

2. Someone to check my work on how I relabeled the growth metrics (issue # 15 and check BOTH the output and my code)

4. Someone to add to the code a sapling/adult column, including getting the info out of papers or people who are in charge of the papers. (Issue #17)

3. Someone to take over external and endogenous factors affected growth or gsl issue (#11) including getting everyone to send me data, and ideally writing some code to summarize it. 

5. Figure out summary for method (Alana?) 

6. Start working on Rubén's suggested idea of simplifying exogenous factors (in issue 10 now, could be new issue; work with Alana who started on this).

7. Simplify endogenous factors (please start an issue # ; work with Alana who started on this).


7 people:
Alana
Ruben
Kavya
Cat
Ailene
Janneke
Fredi

Do later: 
Refs and info on upper and temperature lower limits to tree growth and development.
Work on figures summarizing table results
Measurement diffs of growth -- in a box.
	Measurement -- see box/figure  (include measurement only here or briefly so we move through it fast; Table results: What metrics of growth? could fit here)
