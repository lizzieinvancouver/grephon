cufar2014,emw,temperate forests,1,Fagus syl.,forests across Slovenia,tree ring,merged individuals across sites,153 trees,annual core,plant vegetative phenology,leaf unfolding,general leaf colouring,no,NA,starttoend,yes,NA,Fig 3-4,no,NA,I support their no conclusion,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,maybe! They did the comparison very directly but see my concerns ….,not clear how the got the phenology data to match the tree core data,,,
wheeler2016,emw,Swiss Alps,1,Salix herbacea,three trasects in Swiss Alps,permanent plot,across sites/populations (space for time),480 shrubs,stem density; proportion flowering; proportion fruiting,snowmelt day,snowmelt day,none,not mentioned,NA,NA,NA,they look at snowmelt day by all their growth metrics; results by growth metric vary,NA,no,NA,they don't directly measure it and their growth metrics are not super appropriate for our question,yes,NA,notsure,they look at frost damage but not directly linked,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,"no, but I appreciated their ecological slant",for us -- they are too focused on snowmelt and fitness-related stuff,,space for time study (they even merged data across years),
