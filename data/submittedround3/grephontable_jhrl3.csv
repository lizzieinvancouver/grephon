Phenology data: 13633 observations between 1873-1951 collected at 634 locations and 18555 observations collected between 2008-2021 at 6867 locations. for the two conifers, only data from the last time period",annual ringwidth (from a core),plant vegetative phenology,SOS (budburst),EOS (leaf coloration),no,NA,NA,no,"The authors present evidence that 1) the growing season (according to temperature) has expanded; and 2) that budburst has come earlier. Despite these two findings, they demonstrate that the days where growth climate relationships are strongest hasn't shifted, which they view as evidence that despite a change in temperature and the timing of growth, the nature of the gsl-growth hasn't changed.","fig 3 g-i for changes in phenology, fig 4 for growth-temperature relationships, fig A3 (which includes start / end of thermal season) for growth-temperature relationships from individual chronologies",no,NA,"They didn't compare absolute growth with growing seaon length, they just looked at trends over time and the months when sensitivity is highest",yes - growth,NA,yes - growth,NA,temperature (30 day running mean),no,NA,no,NA,NA,yes,"no. To be fair this was not their goal - they wanted to test whether climate-growth relationships are stationary - in other words, is growth sensitive to temperature in the same months / to the same degree over time (this is important for dendro reconstruction of temperature). The phenology data was used in a comparative sense - is the trees growing period shifting and does this line up with when tree growth is sensitive to climate (the months?). ","They did the usual dendro stuff - removed temporal trends, looked at growth as deviations from a mean (I think), averaged across (an unknown number) of individuals within a site, and averaged multiple chronologies. Then they conducted a 'moving window correlation analysis'","However, there were several places I thought their study could have done better. For one, they could have asked whether growth (ring width) increased over time, but instead they did the usual dendro standardization / averaging. They found some interesting trends with budburst and autumn coloration over time (budburst earlier, autumn coloration also earlier but not as much), suggesting that growing season lengths increased due to warming, but not as much as they could have - implying a constraint - but they never tested this. They also could have tested whether growing season length (or start, or end) correlates with absolute growth - if they had merged their phenology with their growth data.","Interestingly, they find that the shifts in autumn phenology are much more variable and in many cases different than expected (shifts to earlier senescence rather than later). While these impacts are not as large as effects on budburst, so that GSL based on phenology is increasing as expected, it does suggest some sort of constraint, external or endogenous, on GSL that presumably would also impact growth.",

While that model was parameterized with a lot of data (e.g. time series of temperature, CO2, etc), the underlying link between temperature (growing season from their point of view) and NPP is based on the model - which includes assumptions about how climate, N and CO2 (positively) contribute to photosynthesis (Farquhar model), and how other factors (disturbance) reduce it.",yes - growth (NPP),NA,yes - growth (NPP),NA,"temperature, CO2, N, disturbance",no,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,"no. Their goal was to quantify whether Canadian forests are a net source or sink and over which time periods, and which external factors (climate, N, Co2, disturbance) were responsible","I think the ecoystem modeling approach they took was probably fine at the time (likely updated now), but it wasn't really explained well enough to fully assess the assumptions and data that went into it.","This study wasn't super relevant to our specific question, so not much to say here (without asking for a whole scale change in the entire study).",,
