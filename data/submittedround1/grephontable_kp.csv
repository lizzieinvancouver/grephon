They didn’t explicitly look at GSL, but they did use snow melt out and snow free growing degree days as a proxy. If we believe this is a good proxy for start of growing season for this shrub then the paper was good and looked at variation in response to cliamte across elevations too. I just wish they had explicitly also looked at leaf phenology to describe growing season onset",,,
