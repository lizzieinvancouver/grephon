some conceptual figure2.0.png
Ruben on 1 Feb 2023, and here's the email

between checking and re-re-re-reading grant applications I had a lot of fun trying to translate Mondays' discussion to a figure of shorts (attached). I tried to build it around a sigmoidal model of growth, which I think is pretty supported by most dendrometer data, and 3 parameters [see top left of figure]

... and then trying to be as explicit with consequences, predictions and existing support as possible. I think it could be a way of, after the much reading we have done, start to shift towards being more systematic (I like the idea that those 3 parameters have very different results for each of the responses... maybe usable for testing?)
