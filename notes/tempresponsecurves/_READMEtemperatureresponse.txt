README on Lizzie trying to find actual sources of growth response curves to temperature for trees ...

Best options I found:
1) Rezende-bozinovical_etal_2019 -- Fig 2a shows a meta-analysis
2) graph.jpg (from Rob Guy, see below ... he also told me there is no universal growth response, some notes in my gray and green notebook)

Also found:
Wooliver_etal_2022.pdf -- semi-random, not sure it really covers the relevant physiology lit?
Criddle_etal_2005.pdf -- are these people trustworthy?

Graph.jpg From Rob Guy on 15 March 2024, with this in his email:

Thanks for the attachments. The curves presented in Fig 2a are consistent with my understanding (steeper on the right than the left).  Attached is the very old figure from Larcher that I used for teaching purposes.
