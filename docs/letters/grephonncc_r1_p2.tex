Editor and reviewer comments (we provide below the full context of the three reviewers' comments) are in \emph{italics}, while our responses are in regular text. \\ 

{\bf Response to editors' comments:} \\  % See dothisGREPHON for notes on figures and overhaul of Section 3. 

We appreciate the editors' thoughtful comments and the chance to revise this work. ...

\begin{enumerate}
\item Completely overhauled the third section (`Building a new framework for growth Ã— season length relationships') to be focused on the most critical questions to answer and clear suggestions of how to do it
\item Added a discussion of primary versus secondary growth early on and we return this as we develop our points  (concern of R1 and R3) 
\item New figure and clear discussion of importance of understanding growth rate (concern of R2) 
\item Added new figures ... 
\end{enumerate}

Overlapping concerns across reviewers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Growth rate (err, maybe just R2) 
\item Different types of growth (primary versus secondary ... roots?):  R1 and R3
\item No clear framework! Not sure what to do next. R2 and R3 
\end{enumerate}
