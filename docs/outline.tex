\section{What to do next or some day ...}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Review our old notes and outlines
\item Fill out table Janneke is making ... what do we want out of it?
\item How to review the papers (pick them) for Janneke's table
\item Measurement comparisons: growth estimated from tree rings (climatology), tree rings (ecology), tree rings in experiments or such?
\item Why is the Parent et al. 2012 curve different than Alan's curves for $A_{net}$?
\end{enumerate}


\section{Outline}

Translator:
\begin{enumerate}
\item GSL: growing season length
\item RL: resource limitation
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction (what's happened in the past and where this paper goes)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unexpected controversy over GSL and tree growth \todo{needs organizing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Basics: GDD model of growth suggests GSL x growth (with some base temperature for GDD)
\item Back when: Ecosystem scale growth (NPP?) increases with warming
\item New studies: Tree rings don't show GSL x growth (ring width)
\item But ... Tree ring old studies do show GSL x growth (ring width) \todo{Do they? Need refs}
\end{enumerate}
\item What's going on?! (Briefly)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Measurement issues 
\item Biophysical constraints
\item Resource limitations
\end{enumerate}
\item Here, we. ...
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our premise is that some hypotheses for what's going may be tractably already answered by combining data across fields/methods
\item Is our premise also that constraint issues are not well included in current hypotheses?
\item And, you could go far by cross-field tweaking of what each field is doing
\end{enumerate}
\item This is important! \todo{fit this into intro}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Carbon storage and climate change
\item Fundamental to physiology, species assembly
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Section: Review three reasons for not growing (Our opinion on now)
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Overview paragraph of three reasons
\begin{enumerate} 
\item measurement -- see box  (include measurement only here, maybe)
\item Resource limitation
\item Constraints
\end{enumerate}
\item Resource limitation, evidence for an against \todo{we need to go back to literature to work on this}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Nutrients
\item Water
\item Is this more species-specific?
\end{enumerate}
\item Constraints, evidence for an against \todo{we need to go back to literature to work on this}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Leaf life span
\item Budset stuff ... (Zohner, Sool.)
\item Evidence across species? Or which is species-specific
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item What do do next (The future! Is there a framework to our future directions? It would be nice if we found one)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tree ring people should ... get better phenology data and a better sampling design ... and figure out the transfer f(x)
\begin{enumerate}
\item core trials with phenology data
\item PEP725 x ITRB plot -- sampling overlap; sample more places/species withe phenology data
\item Take more fine-scale measurements
\end{enumerate}
\item Permanent plot data (provenance/forestry plots) need some temporal resolution and need more allometry data
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do they have GSL? 
\item They calculate growth every 5 years, they need annual data!
\item Allometry here is big opportunity: measuring at different heights (more fine-scale data)
\end{enumerate}
\item Greenhouse/chamber experiments
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our experiment (which needs a name)!
\item VPD x temperature curves -- figure those out, include more xylogenesis here
\end{enumerate}
\item Big experiments
\begin{enumerate}
\item You could do one for this topic
\item Measure GSL and tree rings in other ones: FACE, Phynwald, Rainout things, SPRUCE 
\end{enumerate}
\item Constraint experiments (yes, messy topic ... not sure where all this goes ...)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Give plants everything they want and show they still shut down growth at the same time (this goes with some full factorial experiments with drought etc. so we could estimate when the constrain matters ... we could say 'of course there is a constraint but we need to better understand when it would matter with climate change)
\item How do people show contraints?
\begin{enumerate}
\item You sort of need the mechanism ... molecular, experiment on proximate cues etc.
\item Show variation across latitude often for this
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Wait, WTF is a constraint? Or is there a gradient of constraint to RL ... }
\begin{enumerate}

\item Lifespan determination growth mush
\begin{enumerate}
\item Seasonal growth stops: Budset, Zohner equinox paper
\item Does high temperature fit here? (Definitely on a different timescale)
\end{enumerate}
\item High temperature limitation -- enzymatically it's over
\item Low temperature limitation -- sort of like energy limitation 
\item Things we feel sure are resource limitation
\begin{enumerate}
\item Nutrients
\item Water
\end{enumerate}
\item Terms we could use. ... 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Phenomenological without a real mechanism (plants stop growing at the same time every year)
\item External versus internal
\item Abiotic versus biotic
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


{\bf Things that need a home}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Patterns of GSL x growth across elevation/latitude
\item What is growing season length? (Actually when growth starts? Or something else?) 
\item Measurement issues
\begin{enumerate}
\item Maybe they are growing and you measured the wrong thing
\item What scale of effect can we detect (and do we expect)?
\item Maybe we are measuring the wrong species ...
\end{enumerate}
\item Conifers (tree ring data) versus deciduous (phenology data)
\item Conifers: Does leafout matter in conifers or would it be much more related to when they start photosynthesizing with old leaves?
\item Species diversity in tree ring studies ... maybe make table on whether the studies with tree rings and growth have looked at dominant canopy species \todo{add to Janneke's table?}
\item Maybe ... which species have budset constraints been shown in?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Figure ideas}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ruben's figure
\item Alana's rate x temperature (x limitations) figure
\item ISI cross-pollination currently across fields
\begin{enumerate}
\item tree rings in climatology
\item tree rings in ecology
\item constraint folks
\item forestry plots (provenance trials)
\item experiments ... 
\end{enumerate}
\item PEP725 x ITRB plot
\end{enumerate}
