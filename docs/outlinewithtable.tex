\section{Current take home results}


Out of 37 papers (we have currently 56 rows of data) 20 found evidence for GS x growth (any which way) and  10 found evidence for our definition of GS x growth. Those papers with any evidence are:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}

\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
 [1] "chen2000"                 "cuny2012"                
 [3] "delpierre2017"            "drew & downes 2018"

[13] "moser2019"                "oddi2022"                
[15] "silvestro2023"            "soolananayakanahally2013"

\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

And those papers with evidence of our definition are (side query: how come Zhang2021 is here, but not showing up above?):
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> sort(unique(eviour$paper_id))
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
 [1] "cuny2012"           "delpierre2017"      "drew & downes 2018"
 [4] "grossiord2022"      "mckown2016"         "michelot2012"      
 [7] "oddi2022"           "silvestro2023"      "vitasse2009"       
[10] "zhang2021"         
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
and they cover both wood and plant vegetative studies:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> table(eviour$gsl)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
plant vegetative phenology          satellite derived 
                         6                          1 
            wood phenology 
                         5 
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
\newpage
Broadening beyond our definition includes studies where GS is not measured, or climate is used instead:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> table(eviany$gsl)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
              not measured plant vegetative phenology 
                         3                          9 
         satellite derived temperature or snow metric 
                         2                          4 
            wood phenology 
                         5 
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

\newpage
I have not checked whether that is different than random, but you can contrast that with the overall suite of GSL metrics and it looks representative to me on quick glance:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> table(d$gsl)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
                      date               not measured 
                         1                         10 
plant vegetative phenology          satellite derived 
                        21                          4 
temperature or snow metric             wood phenology 
                         7                         12 
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

\section{Getting back to writing our paper}

\emph{Reminder of what we expected the table we worked on since April to help us with ...}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Section: Review three reasons for not growing 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Overview paragraph of three reasons
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Measurement -- see box/figure  (include measurement only here or briefly so we move through it fast)
\item Resource limitation
\item Constraints
\end{enumerate}
\item Resource limitation, evidence for an against \todo{Table will help us with this}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Nutrients
\item Water
\item Is this more species-specific?
\end{enumerate}
\item Constraints, evidence for an against \todo{Table will help us with this}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Leaf life span
\item Budset stuff ... (Zohner, Sool.)
\item Evidence across species? Or which is species-specific
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item What do do next (The future! Is there a framework to our future directions? It would be nice if we found one) \todo{This needs a total overhaul after the table; figure out the section headers}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5ex}
So, we hoped these studies would help with the prevalence of evidence for external and endogenous factors. I haven't got as far on this (and we did not consistently enter whether growth or GSL or both was limiting) but here's a quick look at the 26 papers that found evidence of external factors and 13 that found evidence of endogenous (in contrast to 9 papers that looked but did not find evidence of external or 20 endogenous factors).

For those that did, they looked at these GSL metrics:

\section{Next steps}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How to finalize the table cleaning?
\begin{enumerate}
\item I would prefer this all documented over github than being done over email
\item Not sure how to resolve Richardson study
\item And there are likely more ....
\end{enumerate}
\item How do we want to analyze the table?
\begin{enumerate}
\item One idea is to break out what parts of the paper people are working on and then they do their own analysis -- but built off one set of shared cleaning code or such.
\item Work on analysis using the table is centralized in one person
\end{enumerate}
\item Do we want to make a figure that reviews the path diagram from GSL to growth and somehow summarizes what we have found?
\item Do we wan to re-analyze any of the studies that have the data but did not test our definition? (Dow2022, Finzi2020, Stridbeck2022, zani2020, chen1998, ren2019)
\item What else?
\end{enumerate}
