\section{Current take home results}


Out of 30 papers (we have currently 43 rows of data) 16 found evidence for GS x growth (any which way) and  9 found evidence for our definition of GS x growth. Those papers with any evidence are:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> sort(unique(eviany$paper_id))
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
 [1] "Cuny2012"                 "Drew & Downes 2018"      
 [3] "Etzold2021"               "Gao2022"                 
 [5] "Keenan et al 2014"        "Moser2019"               
 [7] "Oddi2022"                 "Silvestro2023"           
 [9] "Soolananayakanahally2013" "Zhu2021"                 
[11] "delpierre2017"            "francon2020"

[15] "michelot2012"             "wheeler2016"             
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

And those papers with evidence of our definition are:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> sort(unique(eviour$paper_id))
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] "Cuny2012"           "Drew & Downes 2018" "Oddi2022"          
[4] "Silvestro2023"      "Zhang2021"          "delpierre2017"     
[7] "grossiord2022"      "mckown2016"         "michelot2012"      
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
and they cover both wood and plant vegetative studies:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> table(eviour$gsl)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
plant vegetative phenology          satellite derived 
                         5                          1 
            wood phenology 
                         5 
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
Broadening beyond our definition includes studies where GS is not measured, or climate is used instead:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> table(eviour$gsl)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
plant vegetative phenology          satellite derived 
                         5                          1 
            wood phenology 
                         5 
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

\newpage
I have not checked whether that is different than random, but you can contrast that with the overall suite of GSL metrics and it looks representative to me on quick glance:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> table(d$gsl)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}

                               not measured 
                                          5 
                 plant vegetative phenology 
                                         15 
                          satellite derived 
                                          3 
                 temperature or snow metric 
                                          5 
                             wood phenology 
                                         12 
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

They also cover a pretty wide diversity of growth metrics:

\section{Getting back to writing our paper}

\emph{Reminder of what we expected the table we worked on since April to help us with ...}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Section: Review three reasons for not growing 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Overview paragraph of three reasons
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Measurement -- see box/figure  (include measurement only here or briefly so we move through it fast)
\item Resource limitation
\item Constraints
\end{enumerate}
\item Resource limitation, evidence for an against \todo{Table will help us with this}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Nutrients
\item Water
\item Is this more species-specific?
\end{enumerate}
\item Constraints, evidence for an against \todo{Table will help us with this}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Leaf life span
\item Budset stuff ... (Zohner, Sool.)
\item Evidence across species? Or which is species-specific
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item What do do next (The future! Is there a framework to our future directions? It would be nice if we found one) \todo{This needs a total overhaul after the table; figure out the section headers}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5ex}
So, we hoped these studies would help with the prevalence of evidence for external and endogenous factors. I haven't got as far on this (and we did not consistently enter whether growth or GSL or both was limiting) but here's a quick look at the 21 papers that found evidence of external factors and 8 that found evidence of endogenous (in contrast to 6 papers that looked but did not find evidence of external or 17 endogenous factors).

For those that did, they looked at these GSL metrics:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}

\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}

\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
